Every complaint and change I've ever had, and shared got fixed or put into the game; at least in some way. I LOVE the builders base. Great idea. I have an idea doe another unit/barracks for the builders base. So, main village had the barracks and the dark barracks; why not a builders barracks and an apprentice barracks? As you level up the apprentice barracks you can train new apprentices that go to your main main for different abilities. Level one could just be an extra builder. At level 2, it could unlock an ability that boosts the apprentice builder, but cost more. At level 3 it could be 2 builders, same ability. Level 4 could be a Gardner builder that gets rid of the trees and things in your main base for free. So on, so forth. Those are just ideas. Still love the game, still doing a great job.
